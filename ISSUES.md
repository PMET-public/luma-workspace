# Reporting Issues

1. Check [open issues](https://github.com/PMET-public/luma-workspace/issues) first. If they issue hasn't been reported, proceed with creating a _New Issue –or– Request_

2. Make sure to include a URL of the page where you are having the issue.

3. Include a screenshot:
   - Some issues are trivial to reproduce, and a simple screenshot is all that is needed. If you feel a screenshot will suffice, include one instead of a video.
